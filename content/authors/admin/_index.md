I am a full professor at the Constantine 1 University  [Urban Freight Lab](https://urbanfreightlab.com/) and a member of the [Laboratoire d'Automatique et Robotique de Constantine (LARC)](https://www.supply-chain-transportation.uw.edu/). My research is focused on advanced control systems, which I apply to renewable energy systems, electrical drives, among others.

I completed my PhD in Engineering Systems Design in 2018 at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/) and spent a year as a visiting researcher at the [MIT Intelligent Transportation System Lab](https://www.its.mit.edu/). I hold an MSC in Computational Statistics ([ETH Zurich](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs)) and a BSc in Economics and Business ([LUISS](https://economiaefinanza.luiss.it/)).
