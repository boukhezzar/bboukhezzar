On November 16, the 2024 Civic Innovation Challenge officially started. All PIs of the projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation CIVIC grant were presented during a three-day kickoff event, including our project on community micropantries. Presented ongoing projects spans from food insecurity, low-income housing, and air quality sensors. I am excited to be part of this amazing cohort of community-led projects!
