Congratulation to the City of Minneapolis and the Seattle Department of Transportation for being awarded a stage-2 [SMART Grant](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-12/FY24%20Stage%202%20SMART%20Project%20List.pdf)! The $14 million grant established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will digitize curb space management and planning for urban logistics mobility at scale in the city of Seattle and Minneapolis. I am super excited to collaborate on this grant with both cities!
