Delivery vehicle drivers are experiencing increasing challenges in finding available curb space to park in urban areas, which increases instances of **cruising for parking and parking in unauthorized spaces**. Policies traditionally used to reduce cruising for parking for passenger vehicles, such as parking fees and congestion pricing, are ineffective at changing delivery drivers’ travel and parking behaviors. 

**Intelligent parking systems** that use real-time curb availability information to better route and park vehicles can reduce cruising for parking, but they have never been tested for delivery vehicle drivers. The current study tested whether providing real-time curb availability information to delivery drivers reduces the travel time and distance spent cruising for parking.

A curb parking information system deployed in a study area in Seattle (WA), displayed real-time curb availabilities on a mobile app called **OpenPark**. A controlled experiment assigned drivers’ deliveries in the study area with and without access to OpenPark. The data collected showed that when OpenPark was used, drivers’ cruising for parking time significantly decreased by 27.9 percent, and their total vehicle miles traveled decreased by 4.3 percent. These results demonstrate the potential for implementing intelligent parking systems to improve the efficiency of urban logistics systems.
