Conventionally, the **distribution of goods and services** in North American cities have mainly relied on diesel-powered internal combustion engine vehicles. The recent developments in **electromobility** have provided an opportunity to reduce some of the negative externalities generated by urban logistics systems. 

**Cargo e-bikes**—electric cycles specially designed for cargo transportation—represent an alternative environmentally friendly and safer mode for delivering goods and services in urban areas. However, lack of infrastructure, legal uncertainties, and a cultural and economic attachment to motorized vehicles has hindered their adoption. 

**Cities play a crucial role** in reducing these barriers and creating a leveled playing field where cargo e-bikes can be essential to urban logistics systems.

In collaboration with [PeopleForBikes]( https://www.peopleforbikes.org/), we designed the Biking the Goods guide to 
1. inform urban planners about what are cargo e-bikes
2. identify case studies of successful cargo e-bike deployments
3. identify actionable strategies cities can take to encourage their adoption while guaranteeing safety for all road users
