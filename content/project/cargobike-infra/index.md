Electric cargo cycles are often considered a viable alternative mode for delivering goods in an urban area. However, cities in the U.S. are struggling to regulate cargo cycles, with most authorities applying the same rules used for motorized vehicles or traditional bicycles. One reason is the lack of understanding of the relationship between existing regulations and transport infrastructure and the cargo cycle parking and driving behaviors.
In this study, we analyzed a cargo cycle pilot test in Seattle and collected detailed data on the types of infrastructure used for driving and parking. GPS data were augmented by installing a video camera on the cargo cycle and recording the types of infrastructure used (distinguishing between the travel lane, bike lane, and sidewalk), the time spent on each type, and the activity performed.
