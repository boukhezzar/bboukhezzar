abstract: 'As e-commerce and urban deliveries spike, cities grapple with managing
  urban freight more actively. To manage urban deliveries effectively, city planners
  and policy makers need to better understand driver behaviors and the challenges
  they experience in making deliveries. In this study, we collected data on commercial
  vehicle (CV) driver behaviors by performing ridealongs with various logistics carriers.
  Ridealongs were performed in Seattle, Washington, covering a range of vehicles (cars,
  vans, and trucks), goods (parcels, mail, beverages, and printed materials), and
  customer types (residential, office, large and small retail). Observers collected
  qualitative observations and quantitative data on trip and dwell times, while also
  tracking vehicles with global positioning system devices. The results showed that,
  on average, urban CVs spent 80% of their daily operating time parked. The study
  also found that, unlike the common belief, drivers (especially those operating heavier
  vehicles) parked in authorized parking locations, with only less than 5% of stops
  occurring in the travel lane. Dwell times associated with authorized parking locations
  were significantly longer than those of other parking locations, and mail and heavy
  goods deliveries generally had longer dwell times. We also identified three main
  criteria CV drivers used for choosing a parking location: avoiding unsafe maneuvers,
  minimizing conflicts with other users of the road, and competition with other commercial
  drivers. The results provide estimates for trip times, dwell times, and parking
  choice types, as well as insights into why those decisions are made and the factors
  affecting driver choices.'
