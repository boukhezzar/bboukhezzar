abstract: Common-carrier parcel lockers have emerged as a secure, automated, self-service
  means of delivery consolidation in congested urban areas, which are believed to
  mitigate last-mile delivery challenges through reducing out-of-vehicle delivery
  times and consequently vehicle dwell times at the curb. However, little research
  exists to empirically demonstrate the environmental and efficiency gains from this
  technology. In this study, we designed a nonequivalent groups pre-test/post-test
  control experiment to estimate the causal effects of a parcel locker on delivery
  times in a residential building in downtown Seattle, WA. The causal effects are
  measured in terms of vehicle dwell time and the time delivery couriers spend inside
  the building, through the difference-in-difference method and using a similar nearby
  residential building as a control. The results showed a statistically significant
  decrease in time spent inside the building, and small yet insignificant reduction
  in delivery vehicle dwell time at the curb. The locker was also well received by
  the building managers and residents.
