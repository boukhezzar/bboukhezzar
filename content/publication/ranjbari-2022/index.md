abstract: Common-carrier parcel lockers present a solution for decreasing delivery
  times, traffic congestion, and emissions in dense urban areas through consolidation
  of deliveries. Multi-story residential buildings with large number of residents,
  and thus a high volume of online package orders, are one of the best venues for
  installing parcel lockers. But what is the right size for a residential building
  locker that would suit the residents' and building managers' needs? Because of the
  novelty of parcel lockers, there is no clear guideline for determining the right
  locker size and configuration for a residential building given the resident population.
  A small locker would result in packages exceeding capacity and being left in the
  lobby, increasing the building manager's workload and confusing and inconveniencing
  users. On the other hand, a large locker is more expensive, more difficult to install,
  and unappealing to residents. To answer this question, we installed a common-carrier
  parcel locker in a residential building in downtown Seattle, WA, U.S.A. Through
  collecting detailed data on locker usage from the locker provider company, we studied
  and quantified carriers' delivery patterns and residents' online shopping and package
  pickup behaviors. We then used this information to model the locker delivery and
  pickup process, and simulated several locker configurations to find the one that
  best suits the delivery needs of the building. These findings could aid urban planners
  and building managers in choosing the right size for residential building lockers
  that meet delivery demand while minimizing costs and contributing to environmental
  benefits.
