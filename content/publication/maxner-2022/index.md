abstract: While freight transportation is a necessary activity to sustain cities'
  social and economic life—enabling the movement and deployment of goods and services
  in urbanized areas—it also accounts for a significant portion of carbon dioxide
  (CO2) emissions. The urban freight ecosystem is a complex network of agents, both
  public and private. Reducing CO2 emissions from urban freight requires the collaboration
  and coordination between those agents, but the motivations behind their goals, strategies
  for achieving those goals, and the challenges faced by each agent may differ. In
  this paper, we document the strategies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions considered
  by cities and private companies with the goal of understanding the challenges to
  progress faced by each. To accomplish this, we interviewed officials from purposefully
  sampled city departments in North America and private companies involved in city
  logistics. We found that cities face challenges related to a lack of strong leadership,
  resources, and policy tools. Companies must consider technological challenges, costs,
  and their workforce before reducing emissions. Cities and companies are challenged
  by the disaggregated nature of the urban freight “system”—a system that is not organized
  at the municipal scale and that is driven by performance and customer expectations.
