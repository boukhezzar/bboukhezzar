abstract: Delivery vehicle drivers are experiencing increasing challenges in finding
  available curb space to park in urban areas, which increases instances of cruising
  for parking and parking in unauthorized spaces. Policies traditionally used to reduce
  cruising for parking for passenger vehicles, such as parking fees and congestion
  pricing, are not effective at changing delivery drivers' travel and parking behaviors.
  Intelligent parking systems that use real-time curb availability information to
  better route and park vehicles can reduce cruising for parking, but they have never
  been tested for delivery vehicle drivers. The current study tested whether providing
  real-time curb availability information to delivery drivers reduces the travel time
  and distance spent cruising for parking. A curb parking information system deployed
  in a study area in Seattle, Wash., displayed real-time curb availabilities on a
  mobile app called OpenPark. A controlled experiment assigned drivers' deliveries
  in the study area with and without access to OpenPark. The data collected showed
  that when curb availability information was provided to drivers, their cruising
  for parking time significantly decreased by 27.9 percent, and their cruising distance
  decreased by 12.4 percent. These results demonstrate the potential for implementing
  intelligent parking systems to improve the efficiency of urban logistics systems.
