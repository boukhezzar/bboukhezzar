abstract: A growing body of research looks specifically at freight vehicle parking
  choices for purposes of deliveries to street retail, and choice impacts on travel
  time/uncertainty, congestion, and emissions. However, little attention was given
  to large urban freight traffic generators, e.g., shopping malls and commercial buildings
  with offices and retail. These pose different challenges to manage freight vehicle
  parking demand, due to the limited parking options. To study these, we propose an
  agent-based simulation approach which integrates data-driven parking-choice models
  and a demand/supply simulation model. A case study compares demand management strategies
  (DMS), influencing parking choices, and their impact in reducing freight vehicle
  parking externalities, such as traffic congestion. DMS include changes to parking
  capacity, availability, and pricing as well as services (centralized receiving)
  and technology-based solutions (directed parking). The case study for a commercial
  region in Singapore shows DMS can improve travel time, parking costs, emission levels
  and reducing the queuing. This study contributes with a generalizable method, and
  to local understanding of technology and policy potential. The latter can be of
  value for managers of large traffic generators and public authorities as a way to
  understand to select suitable DMS.
