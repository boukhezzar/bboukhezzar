abstract: Urban deliveries are traditionally carried out with vans or trucks. These
  vehicles tend to face parking difficulties in dense urban areas, leading to traffic
  congestion. Smaller and nimbler vehicles by design, such as cargo-cycles, struggle
  to compete in distance range and carrying capacity. However, a system of cargo-cycles
  complemented with strategically located cargo-storing hubs can overcome some limitations
  of the cargo-cycles. Past research provides a limited perspective on how demand
  characteristics and parking conditions in urban areas are related to potential benefits
  of this system. To fill this gap, we propose a model to simulate the performance
  of different operational scenarios—a truck-only scenario and a cargo-cycle with
  mobile hubs scenario—under different delivery demand and parking conditions. We
  apply the model to a case study using data synthesized from observed freight-carrier
  demand in Singapore. The exploration of alternative demand scenarios informs how
  demand characteristics influence the viability of the solution. Furthermore, a sensitivity
  analysis clarifies the contributing factors to the demonstrated results. The combination
  of cargo-cycles and hubs can achieve progressive reductions in kilometers-traveled
  and hours-traveled up to around densities of 150 deliveries/km 2 , beyond which
  savings taper off. Whereas the reduction in kilometers-traveled is influenced by
  the the carrying capacity of the cargo-cycle, the reduction in hours-traveled is
  related to to the cargo-cycle ability to effectively decrease the parking dwell
  time by reducing, for instance, the time spent searching for parking and the time
  spent walking to a delivery destination.
