abstract: 'Problem, research strategy, and findings: The transportation sector is
  the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. To articulate
  how cities may combat rising emissions, municipalities throughout the country have
  produced climate action and sustainability plans that outline strategies to reduce
  their carbon footprints from transportation. At the same time, last-mile delivery—also
  known as urban freight—is becoming an increasingly important component of urban
  transport emissions due to the rise of e-commerce. However, few cities are overtly
  pursuing policies to reduce emissions from this subsector. In this research we used
  content analysis to determine the extent to which major cities (based on population
  and growth) were considering or actively developing sustainable urban freight practices.
  We developed a simple contextual scale to compare the comprehensiveness of planning
  trends between cities. This content analysis also identified the strategies those
  cities are considering. Our findings show that fewer than half (45%) of the studied
  cities have considered last-mile freight in sustainability planning at all. Of those,
  only 17 (29%) have articulated an intent to dedicate resources toward achieving
  that goal. Takeaway for practice: We found that urban freight planning is still
  in its infancy in terms of actions taken by municipal agencies. Though some cities
  have comparatively comprehensive plans dedicated to the industry, most are just
  now scratching the surface. Those cities lacking dedicated last-mile freight plans
  can learn from those other cities initiating pilots and collecting data from the
  industry. We point out also, though, that urban freight planning requires an understanding
  of the stakeholders, namely, delivery companies, and the first step for many cities
  is to initiate communication and collaboration with the private sector to better
  understand the environmental impact of urban freight in their city.'
