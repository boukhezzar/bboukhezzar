abstract: 'Increased use of ridesourcing leads to increased pick-up and drop-off activity.
  This may slow traffic or cause delays as vehicles increase curb use, conduct pick-up
  and drop-off activity directly in the travel lane, or slow to find and connect with
  passengers. How should cities respond to this change in an effort to keep travel
  lanes operating smoothly and efficiently? This research evaluates two strategies
  in Seattle, WA, in an area where large numbers of workers commute using ridesourcing
  services: (i) a change of curb allocation from paid parking to passenger load zone
  (PLZ), and (ii) a geofencing approach by transportation network companies (TNCs)
  which directs their drivers and passengers to designated pick-up and drop-off locations
  on a block. An array of data on street and curb activity along three study blockfaces
  was collected, using video and sensor technology as well as in-person observations.
  Data were collected in three phases: (i) the baseline, (ii) after the new PLZs were
  added, expanding total PLZ curb length from 20 ft to 274 ft, and (iii) after geofencing
  was added to the expanded PLZs. The added PLZs were open to any passenger vehicle
  (not just TNC vehicles), weekdays 7:00–10:00 a.m. and 2:00–7:00 p.m. The results
  showed that the increased PLZ allocation and geofencing strategy reduced the number
  of pick-ups/drop-offs in the travel lane, reduced dwell times, increased curb use
  compliance, and increased TNC passenger satisfaction. The two strategies, however,
  had no observable effect on travel speeds or traffic safety in the selected study
  area.'
