abstract: Understanding factors that drive the parking choice of commercial vehicles
  at delivery stops in cities can enhance logistics operations and the management
  of freight parking infrastructure, mitigate illegal parking, and ultimately reduce
  traffic congestion. In this paper, we focus on this decision-making process at large
  urban freight traffic generators, such as retail malls and transit terminals, that
  attract a large share of urban commercial vehicle traffic. Existing literature on
  parking behavior modeling has focused on passenger vehicles. This paper presents
  a discrete choice model for commercial vehicle parking choice in urban areas. The
  model parameters were estimated by using detailed, real-world data on commercial
  vehicle parking choices collected in two commercial urban areas in Singapore. The
  model analyzes the effect of several variables on the parking behavior of commercial
  vehicle drivers, including the presence of congestion and queueing, attitudes toward
  illegal parking, and pricing (parking fees). The model was validated against real
  data and applied within a discrete-event simulation to test the economic and environmental
  impacts of several parking measures, including pricing strategies and parking enforcement.
